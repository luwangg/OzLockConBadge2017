# OzLockConBadge2017
Hardware and Firmware for the OzLockCon2017 Badge

Derived from the uDuck:
https://github.com/insecurityofthings/uDuck - as you can probably tell from the source code.

The hardware *may* support the uDuck firmware as the circuit is based off it - but i screwed something up and it doesn't want to work.
Ran out of time to debug so focused on the flashy flashy.

# Warning!
don't solder the USB connector onto the badge until you check the pin out! 
i screwed up and reversed the pads on the footprint - again...
